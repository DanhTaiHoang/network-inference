Conclusion
=============================================

* Accuracy: FEM outperforms other existing methods, especially in the limit of large coupling variability and small sample sizes.

* Efficiency: FEM update is multiplicative and not incremental as MLE update, therefore FEM is significantly faster than MLE.

* Facilitation: FEM does not have any tunable parameter, while MLE with gradient descent have an undetermined parameter, learning rate. 

* Generality: FEM can systematically expand to higher-order interactions.
