Network Inference in Stochastic Systems
==============================================

Introduction
-----------------------------
We developed a data-driven approach for network inference in stochastic systems, namely Free Energy Minimazation (FEM). From configurations of variables, we identify the interactions between them, then make predictions. It turn out that FEM outperforms other existing methods such as mean field approximations and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), especially in the regimes of large coupling variability and small sample sizes. Besides better performance, FEM is parameter-free and significantly faster than MLE.
